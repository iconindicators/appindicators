  * On computer startup when the indicator is set to autostart,
    sometimes the indicator can become unresponsive.
    The end user can set the property

        X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=120

    in

        ~/.config/autostart/indicator-lunar.py.desktop

    to delay the indicator startup (for two minutes) avoiding the issue.
    For new installations, by default, the value is set to zero.
  * Removed the preference for autostart.
    To change indicator autostart (off or on), open the file

        ~/.config/autostart/indicator-lunar.py.desktop

    and add/edit the setting to either

        X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true

    or

        X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false

    Alternatively, add the indicator using Startup Applications.
    For new installations, by default, autostart will be set to true.

  * Only create the log file when needed.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 17 Jan 2013 16:30:00 +1000


indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.18-1) precise; urgency=low

    being out of (alphabetical) order...now fixed.
  * Added logging to exceptions.

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Modified the download counts for architecture independent binary packages.
    If a binary package exists in two (or more) places but has different
    versions, the download count for each binary package is counted (for the
    first instance of a given version number).  This means that different
    versions are treated as separate packages but are still combined under
    the common name.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 27 Nov 2012 22:28:25 +1000


indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Add a combine PPA option which combines the statistics when the PPA
    user/name are the same.
    If a published binary is architecture specific (such as compiled C), the
    download count is summed across all instances of that published binary.
    If a published binary is not architecture specific (such as Python), the
    download count is not summed (as it is assumed to be the same binary).
    The version number is retained only if it is identical across all
    instances of a published binary.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 22 Nov 2012 10:49:03 +1000

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.9-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Constant removing/adding of menu items was leaking memory, so combined
    menu build/rebuild methods.  Still get the (presumed benign) warning
    "Trying to remove a child that doesn't believe we're it's parent"
    warning.
  * Now logs in once to LaunchPad - each login uses an excessive amount of
    memory.
