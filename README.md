## Install from PyPI

To install the indicator from `PyPI` to a virtual environment in `$HOME/.local/venv_indicators`, refer to the indicator's `PyPI` page listed in the introduction above.

Note that if installing over an existing install with the same version, will need to add `--force-reinstall` after `--upgrade` (which may be removed from a [future release](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8238) of `pip`).
