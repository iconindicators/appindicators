#TODO Need to figure out for indicator-lunar how to install pyephem et al 
# via the preinst/postinst scripts working given how `pip` has changed things.
# If I cannot, need to add something about how to install and remove on the main README.md
# See discussion about error on Debian bookworm and venv.


#TODO When installing indicator-lunar on Debian bookworm, got an error:
#
#     error: externally-managed-environment
#
#     × This environment is externally managed
#     ╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
#     python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
#     install.
#
#     If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
#     create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
#     Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
#     sure you have python3-full installed.
#
#     If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
#     it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
#     virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
#
#     See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more information.
#
#     note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
#     hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
#
# This will affect Ubuntu 24.04 onward as Pip has been changed such that
# Python packages need to be installed into a virtual environment.
#
# So for ephem/sgp4 and eventually skyfield, need to make a change.
# 
#   https://stackoverflow.com/a/75696359/2156453
#
# Perhaps in the debian/postinst all we need to do is modify
#   sudo pip3 install --ignore-installed --upgrade ephem sgp4 || true
# to be instead something that can do the following...
#   
#    71  cd /home/bernard
#    72  python3 -m venv .venv
#    73  sudo apt install python3.11-venv 
#    74  python3 -m venv .venv
#    75  source .venv/bin/activate
#    76  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
#    77  cd Programming/PlayListMaker/
#    78  python3 -m pip install -e .

#
# If the postinst will no longer work in kicking off an install to a venv,
# will have to do a runtime check in the indicator to look for ephem et al
# and if not present, explain to the user how to install via pip into a venv.
#
# If the postinst does work, likely need a postrm to clean up the pip installation.
#
# Maybe go with a modified postinst (and a new postrm) but ALSO have a runtime check
# to ensure ephem et al are installed and if not, point user to a readme on how to install
# (but at this stage if ephem is not present, the installation should be assumed to be broken).
#
# How permanent is a venv?  Do we need a venv for each indicator as needed,
# and even then one for each version of each indicator?
#
# Can Python script in /usr/share/indicator-lunar refer to a Python library in a venv?
# Need the full path to the venv?
