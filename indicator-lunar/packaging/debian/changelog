indicator-lunar (1.0.96-1) bionic; urgency=low

  * Due to duplications, misspellings and the requirement for historical
    support, the list of stars is now obtained from named stars:

		http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/WGSN/IAU-CSN.txt

  * Replaced '--' with '-' in cache filenames for minor planet apparent
    magnitude and satellite general perturbations.
  * The equinox and solstice are now displayed in date order..

indicator-lunar (1.0.95-1) bionic; urgency=low

  * Satellite data now uses OMM format rather than TLE.
    As a result, the international designator will look slightly different.
    Requires PIP3 package 'sgp4' which should be automatically installed.
    If not:

        sudo pip3 install --upgrade sgp4

indicator-lunar (1.0.87-1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Missing magnitude values in the Minor Planet Center data files
    coupled with incorrect handling within PyEphem produced spurious magnitude
    values, causing comets and minor planets to appear when they should not.
    Will take up to four days for your cache to clear and see changes.
  * Bug fix: Satellites would not display if the user changed the preferences
    from no satellites checked to one or more satellites checked.
  * Reduced search time for visible satellite passes.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 4 Mar 2021 22:24:19 +1000

indicator-lunar (1.0.85-1) xenial; urgency=low

  * On computer startup when the indicator is set to autostart,
    sometimes the indicator can become unresponsive.
    The end user can set the property

        X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=120

    in

        ~/.config/autostart/indicator-lunar.py.desktop

    to delay the indicator startup (for two minutes) avoiding the issue.
    For new installations, by default, the value is set to zero.
  * Removed the preference for autostart.
    To change indicator autostart (off or on), open the file

        ~/.config/autostart/indicator-lunar.py.desktop

    and add/edit the setting to either

        X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true

    or

        X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false

    Alternatively, add the indicator using Startup Applications.
    For new installations, by default, autostart will be set to true.
  * Removed old eclipse information.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sun, 26 Apr 2020 15:12:25 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.81-1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Under GNOME Shell, the indicator grinds to a halt and if menu items extend
    beyond the bottom of the screen, scrolling does not work.
    Consequently, any item/attribute/preference not directly assisting the
    home astronomer to locate an object has been removed.
    The exceptions are the attributes moon phase, eclipse, solstice/equinox.
  * Removed decimal degrees from azimuth/altitude.
  * Removed right ascension and declination; azimuth/altitude are sufficient.
  * Removed planetary moons; each moon's azimuth/altitude is effectively the
    same as the parent planet for the purposes of the indicator.
  * Removed werewolf warning percentage from preferences and fixed at 96%.
  * Removed date/time format from preferences; uses ISO 8601 without seconds.
  * TLE/OE data file sources are no longer configurable.
  * Bodies which are 'never up' are not displayed.
  * Bodies which are 'always up' only display azimuth/altitude.
  * Bodies below the horizon only display the rise date/time.
  * Bodies above the horizon display the set date/time and azimuth/altitude.
  * Only visible satellite passes (at dawn/dusk for most latitudes) are shown.
  * Added minor planets courtesy of the Minor Planet Center.
  * Magnitude filtering extended to include planets and stars.
  * Added on-click URL for the moon, sun, planets, stars and minor planets.
  * Added preference to hide a body if it is below the horizon (yet to rise).
  * Removed old eclipse information.
  * Dynamically created icons are stored in user cache rather than /tmp.
  * Added hyperlink to the About dialog which links to the error log text file
    (only visible if the underlying file is present).
  * About dialog now pulls the changelog directly from /usr/share/doc rather
    than a redundant duplicate in the installation directory.
  * About dialog now shows copyright, artists and corrected URL for website.
  * Now uses a base class to share functionality amongst indicators.
  * Whilst starting up, a single menu item "Initialising..." is displayed.
    Once fully initialised, the menu proper is shown.
  * When an update is underway or the About/Preferences dialogs are displayed,
    the About/Preferences/Quit menu items are disabled.
  * Update release to xenial as trusty is end of life.
  * Update debian/control Standards-Version to 3.9.7.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 19 Dec 2018 15:57:35 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.79-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: When a comet was 'always up' or 'never up', only that information
    was displayed whereas the remaining information was omitted.
  * Bug fix: When a user had the default URLs for TLE/OE data, those URLs
    would still use http rather than https.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 5 Sep 2018 14:26:24 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.78-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * The comet data source no longer accepts http and so changed to https
    (along with all other URLs).  Well spotted Oleg Moiseichuk!
  * Removed old eclipse information.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 4 Sep 2018 17:16:51 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.77-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Now checks for an internet connection before downloading TLE/OE data.
    This stops the log file cluttering up with failed connection messages.
  * Reduced the download period for TLE/OE data.
  * Removed old eclipse information.
  * Removed user config migration code.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sun, 18 Feb 2018 10:06:38 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.76-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Whitespace padding can now be added to the front/rear of the icon text.
    This is useful in Ubuntu 17.10 as the icon and text are too close together.
  * Updated Russian translation.  Thanks to Oleg Moiseichuk.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 21 Oct 2017 16:01:52 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.75-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: In Ubuntu 16.04 and greater, icons for ubuntu-mono-dark and
    ubuntu-mono-light would not load due to directories not present in the
    underlying index.theme file.
  * Added options to specify the date/time format for attributes.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 6 Oct 2017 12:43:15 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.74-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Corrected warnings in .desktop file.
  * Removed expired eclipse information.
  * About/Preferences dialogs now block each other - only show one at a time.
  * User settings now stored in the directory specified by the environment
    variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME, or, if not present, $HOME/.config
    (existing user settings stored in $HOME are migrated to the new location).
  * Update release to trusty as precise is end of life.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 1 Mar 2017 19:49:38 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.73-1) precise; urgency=low

    zero component for milliseconds which is dropped.
    When parsing from string to a Date/Time a format exception occurs.
  * Removed expired eclipse information.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 1 Mar 2017 19:49:38 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.72-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Bad comet data was causing a core dump.
    Ideally the underlying data would be screened for bad data, but the data
    format is long and convoluted.
    Instead, each comet is computed and if certain attributes are NaN, namely
    earth_distance, phase, size and sun_distance, the comet is deemed to have
    bad data.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 8 Feb 2017 23:42:18 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.71-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: If the moon was unchecked, the icon could not be created nor the
    full moon notification be computed.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2017 12:29:35 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.70-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Mixing of round and int caused a mismatch between the moon's
    phase and illumination.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 14 Dec 2016 11:51:53 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.69-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Now uses the X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled tag for autostart.
  * The satellite notification has been simplified to show the rise/set time
    (rather than date and time) and the rise/set azimuth is rounded.
  * The dynamically created icon is updated only as needed
    (when the lunar illumination, bright limb or theme change values).
  * Changes to formats/rounding of several attributes to improve readability.
  * Minor change to tool tip in the Preferences.
  * Removed expired eclipse information.
  * Fixed PyGIWarnings on imports.
  * Overhaul of icons: only the hicolor icon is required and all theme icons
    are created from the hicolor via the build script.
  * Overhaul of build script: extracted common functions into a separate
    script used by all indicators.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sun, 24 Jul 2016 13:04:17 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.68-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed tooltip on sort satellite by date/time option to reflect the default
    value. 
  * Added tooltip to 'group stars by constellation' option.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 16 Jun 2016 23:58:17 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.67-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed Lintian warnings - added extended description to control file and
    copyright file now refers to common license file for GPL-3.
  * Icons for elementary and ubuntu-mono-light theme were incorrect colours.
  * Updated comment of desktop file.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 6 Jun 2016 23:27:06 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.66-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Tags in which the underlying object is unchecked or no longer
    exists (such as a comet/satellite) are stripped from the indicator text.
    Thanks to Oleg Moiseichuk for the regular expression code and testing!
  * Bug fix: "Orbital Element" renamed to "Comet".  Some user preferences will
    likely need to be reset.
  * The default text for the summary/message for satellite notification now
    includes the Number and International Designator.
  * The satellite menu text has been hard-coded to the format
    'Satellite Name : Number : International Designator'.  The corresponding
    user preference has been removed.
  * Removed the user preferences to specify the satellite on-click URL;
    satellite on-click still remains.
  * Added on-click URL look-up for comets.
  * Added latitude/longitude/elevation of user's location to icon text tags.
  * Added user preference to hide the moon/sun.
  * When computing moon/sun/planets/stars/comets, if the body is never up and
    the user preference is to hide on never up, the remaining computations for
    that body are omitted.
  * Removed expired eclipse information.
  * Use the process wrapper utilities rather than direct calls.
  * Changes to API for showing message dialogs.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 23 Sep 2015 13:20:45 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.65-1) precise; urgency=low

  * New release of pyephem 3.7.6.0.
  * Removed the getBodyCopy() functionality which was a workaround for issue
    https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem/issues/44

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 24 Aug 2015 17:25:16 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.64-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: The values for date/time were appearing in UTC in the Preferences
    dialog.  Although valid values, they should strictly appear in local
    date/time to match the values in the indicator menu.
  * Bug fix: Some textual values were not being translated in the Preferences
    dialog.
  * Removed DD:MM:SS from satellite notification as the notification looked
    too crowded/busy.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 4 Aug 2015 8:06:09 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.63-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: The calculation to determine when the full moon notification
    should be displayed was incorrectly determining the illumination
    percentage and the hourly frequency.
  * Bug fix: The satellite notification would sometimes appear multiple times
    for a given satellite's transit.
  * Made the satellite notification appear about a minute prior to when the
    satellite rises.
  * Added a separator between RA/Dec and Az/Alt as these are independent.
  * Swapped order of RA/Dec and Az/Alt around as Az/Alt is easier to apply.
  * Added the constellation adjacent to each star in the preferences.
  * Stars can now be grouped by their constellation - when activated the
    constellation will be dropped from the star's information.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 23 Jul 2015 22:30:13 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.62-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Omitted the '_' from 'translator-credits' in the About dialog.
  * Bug fix: Satellite notification rise/set azimuth mixed degrees with HMS.

indicator-lunar (1.0.60-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Satellite notification failed due to badly parsed strings.
  * Bug fix: The changelog path was incorrect.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 22 May 2015 18:05:07 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.59-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: The Icon Text was incorrectly parsing nested brackets.
  * Bug fix: The declination attribute was incorrectly including the '-' when
    the value was South.
  * GTK.AboutDialog now uses a Stack rather than Notebook to hold the
    underlying widgets.  Rather than try to (constantly) reverse engineer
    the GTK.AboutDialog to retrofit the changelog tab, the default
    GTK.AboutDialog is used with a hyperlink to the changelog inserted.
  * Removed all display formatting from backend and put into frontend.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 13 May 2015 15:36:53 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.58-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: The Icon Text tag list in the Preferences dialog was missing the
    Tropical Sign tag for stars and all tags for planetary moons.
  * Bug fix: The Right Ascension in degrees was incorrect for all objects.
  * Bug fix: The Bright Limb angle calculation was erroneous due to mixing of
    degrees and radians!
  * Only write out the list of orbital elements and satellites if the user
    elects to not add new.  This reduces the volume of information stored in
    the preferences file by an order of magnitude.
  * The option to automatically add new satellites and orbital
    elements now also works when clicking OK in the preferences.
  * Added distance to Earth in kilometres for the Moon's menu item.    
  * Added timeouts to the TLE/OE download.
  * Added caching of TLE/OE downloaded data to avoid over-taxing the
    respective data sources and to run the indicator off-line.
  * Added warnings to some tooltips about having too many bodies might slow
    down the indicator.
  * Removed elapsed eclipse data.
  * Removed redundant functions to convert hours/minutes/seconds and
    degrees/minutes/seconds to decimal degrees as PyEphem does it for free!
  * Changed some defaults to reduce the amount of data that is displayed.
    When loading satellites or orbital elements, these are not checked.
    Stars are not checked on initial run of the indicator.
  * The lookahead period for computing satellite passes has been reduced to
    two days (previously it was ten days).  This significantly reduces the
    time to refresh whilst only dropping a handful of satellites.
  * For Saturn, added the earth tilt and sun tilt angles. 

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 4 Mar 2015 10:11:04 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.57-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: The last update for satellite TLE data and orbital element data
    was not being set to the current time after an update.
  * Bug fix: In the Preferences, if a bad URL for satellite TLE data or
    orbital element data was entered, the resulting bad data was carried
    through to the indicator proper.
  * Option to automatically add new satellites and/or orbital elements from
    the respective data source.
  * Changed astronomical unit abbreviation from AU to ua to keep in line with
    SI (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-SI_units_mentioned_in_the_SI).
  * Dynamically created icons, such as
      the full moon notification when testing in the preferences;
      the indicator icon which changes according to the current
      lunar illumination percentage;
    are now saved to the /tmp directory (or equivalent).
  * Eclipse type information uses a class, so no longer reliant on strings.
  * Internationalisation.  Many thanks to Oleg Moiseichuk who was instrumental
    in this miracle!
  * Added Russian translation.  Thanks to Oleg Moiseichuk. 
  * About dialog changed to accept translator information.
  * Overhaul of repository structure and build script.

indicator-lunar (1.0.53-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: When checking (adding) a planet in the preferences, the
    magnitude, right ascension, declination, azimuth and altitude were
    omitted from indicator text tags table.
  * Bug fix: When checking (adding) a star in the preferences, the
    constellation, rise time and set time were omitted from indicator text
    tags table.
  * Satellites can now be sorted by rise date/time.  This is now the default.
  * Satellite notification now optionally includes the rise time, set time,
    set azimuth and visibility.
  * Satellite notification now shows satellites in name/number order
    or rise time order, depending on user preference.
  * The URL which is opened on satellite selection is now configurable.
  * Planets/stars which 'never rise' can now be hidden.
  * The TLE data source may be specified as a URL (including local file).
  * Removed the satellite subsequent pass information as it slowed down the
    update of the indicator (noticable when many satellites are checked).
  * When showing only visible passes, satellites which are circumpolar or
    'always up' are included, despite not actually transiting.
  * Added Tropical Sign to stars.
  * Added attributes of the major moons to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.

indicator-lunar (1.0.50-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Handle 'add_credit_section' on Ubuntu 12.04 (was causing a
    segmentation fault).
  * Bug fix: Using the same name for the icon causes the icon to appear the
    same and so appindicator (or something) decides not to reload the icon.
    The workaround is to alternate the icon name on each refresh.

  * Bug fix: When switching to show visible satellite passes to show all
    passes, data for the visibility was not initialised.

indicator-lunar (1.0.45-1) precise; urgency=low

  * A segmentation fault occurs when running with the new version of
    PyEphem 3.7.5.3.  This is a quick release which avoids calling the

    was kicked off (in addition to the main update).
  * Bug fix: Handle "extreme" latitudes when encountering always up or never
    up for rise/set of a body.
  * Planets can now be chosen by the user (for display in the menu).
  * Added rise/set times and constellation to stars.

  * Added satellite/station rise and set times - requires intermittent
    internet access for satellite TLE data.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 30 May 2014 19:48:16 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.41-1) precise; urgency=low

    as it was possible to simulate Gtk.ResponseType.OK by hitting the escape
    key.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 1 Mar 2014 9:55:18 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.35-1) precise; urgency=low

indicator-lunar (1.0.33-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bright limb angle was sometimes negative and needed to be "folded" into
    the correct quadrant by adding 360.
  * Changed the RA/Dec calculations in the bright limb to use Apparent
    Geocentric Position as this gives a closer value to that calculated by
    Meeus.
  * Added RA/Dec to sun and planetary bodies.
  * Thanks to Alan Eliasen (http://futureboy.us) for bright limb and RA/Dec.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 18 Dec 2013 20:23:11 +1000

  * Created a new About dialog showing the changelog.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 16 Dec 2013 23:57:41 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.31-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Removed the option to run using GTKStatusIcon.
    When enabled and the indicator was run on a system which supports
    AppIndicator3, the icon would not appear.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sun, 15 Dec 2013 15:37:43 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.30-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Updated the About dialog to use Gtk+ 3.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sun, 15 Dec 2013 11:47:37 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.29-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added the bright limb angle for the moon and planets.  Thanks to
    'Astronomical Algorithms' by Jean Meeus (and Jürgen Giesen for pointers).
  * The icon is now rotated to reflect the bright limb angle (and reality).
  * The icon text (the tooltip for GTKStatusIcon) is configurable.
  * Changed the control file 'Depends' from Python to Python3.
  * Increased the size of the werewolf summary/body text fields.
  * Modified the Tropical Sign function to use a copy of the body as
    downstream calculations were getting trashed.
  * Put in a preference to use GTKStatusIcon instead of AppIndicator.
    On Lubuntu 12.04 it was found that AppIndicator would be created but the
    tooltip would not render.  This preference lets the user fall back to GTK.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 2 Dec 2013 16:43:23 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.28-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added the upcoming solar/lunar eclipse (until 2099).
    Thanks to Fred Espenak and Jean Meeus and NASA!
  * Updated About dialog to reflect various authors and shoulders of giants.
  * In Ubuntu 13.10 the initial value set by the spinner adjustment
    (for illumination %) was not appearing in the spinner field.
    Need to force the initial value by explicitly setting it.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 24 Oct 2013 20:32:13 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.27-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Displays the tropical sign for each planetary body calculated at midnight
    UTC.  Useful for the astrological enthusiast.
    Thanks to Ignius Drake (elespector@gmail.com) for the code!

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 17 Oct 2013 20:16:33 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.26-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Put in a test button to show the notification text.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 28 Aug 2013 20:22:21 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.25-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The notification text (summary and body) is now configurable.
  * The full moon screen notification is no longer fixed to hourly.
    The indicator updates according to the next date/time for any object's
    rise/set/phase change.  Therefore the full moon notification may occur
    more frequently than hourly.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 21 Aug 2013 16:29:13 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.24-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed another update bug: the timeout call was not being refreshed on each
    update with the correct amount.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 2 Aug 2013 9:06:18 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.23-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The update sometimes occurred slightly earlier than when appropriate,
    likely due to truncating a float to int.  

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 31 Jul 2013 10:11:13 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.22-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug: GLib.timeout_add_seconds() requires an integer for the time
    value.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 8 Jul 2013 8:06:20 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.21-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Only updates when the next rise/set/phase/etc is due.
  * Only create the log file when needed.
    Thanks to Rafael Cavalcanti <rafael.kavalkanti@gmail.com>.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 5 Jul 2013 20:17:12 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.20-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Seems the bug fixed to handle a missing city was not quite fixed!
  * Now logs to a file in the user's HOME directory.
  * Attempt to bring about/preferences to front.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 4 May 2013 1:34:14 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.19-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Revised the icons to fill in a square boundary - no longer stretched on
    Lubuntu/Xubuntu.
  * Icons for Preferences/About now show for Lubuntu/Xubuntu.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 10 Apr 2013 11:17:21 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.18-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Replaced deprecated GObject calls with GLib.
  * Fixed a bug: if a city (from the timezone) was not found, the default
    crashed.  Also added a feature to strip "_" from timezones such as
    America/New_York.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 5 Feb 2013 17:16:54 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.17-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Ensured all calculations are based from the same date/time.
  * Added constellation/distance information to sun menu item. 
  * Added spacing to all menu items.
  * Adjusted each SVG such that the image is horizontally centred and has the
    same left/right margin for each image.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 13 Dec 2012 16:11:23 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.16-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added indent for next moon phases.
  * Consolidate the first and third quarter SVG functions.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 29 Nov 2012 12:47:07 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The next phases of the moon were being dropped out before the phase
    actually arrived!

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 28 Nov 2012 8:51:47 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now creates the lunar phase icon on the fly for each percentage of
    illumination!
  * Works on Ubuntu 12.04/12.10 and Lubuntu 12.10.  
    Untested on Xubuntu 12.04/12.10.
  * On Lubuntu 12.04, the icon fails to update, the icon label/tooltip does
    not display and menu separators look odd.  This occurs because
    AppIndicator3 successfully creates the indicator but then quietly fails to
    update the icon and so on.  The fix is to put in an override (to use GTK
    indicator)...which will only be done if a user screams for it.
    No idea if this occurs on Xubuntu 12.04.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 26 Nov 2012 10:01:40 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.13-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now runs as Python 3 and requires python3-ephem (from same PPA).
  * Kept getting GTK missing child warnings so put menu update back to how it
    was.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:50:07 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.12-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changed how the update/menu was kicked off in the preferences.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 19 Nov 2012 16:43:09 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.11-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added python3-gi to debian/control Depends (for Precise support).
  * Swapped out python-appindicator for gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 in
    debian/control Depends.
  * Simpler handling for creating the indicator - should hopefully sustain
    more environments.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 16 Nov 2012 10:26:05 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.10-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changes for Python3 (but still runs as Python2) and PyGObject.
    Have to run as Python 2 since PPA won't/can't build a Python 3 version of
    Ephem.
  * Switched back to using localtime!
  * Added option to start the werewolf warning at a particular illumination.
  * Using the PyEphem list of cities with latitude/longitude/elevation
    information, now displays sun/moon/planet data such as rise and set times.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 22 Oct 2012 21:24:49 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.9-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Noticed the dates for next phases were out by hours/days.  Removed the
    conversion to localtime (ephem.localtime) and got better/closer reality.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 9 Aug 2012 20:10:27 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.8-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug where the phase and illumination did not match due to
    rounding error.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 9 Aug 2012 19:22:09 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.7-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Handle the case where the directory ~/.config/autostart does not exist.
  * Increased the indent of the submenu items by one space.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 7 Aug 2012 22:40:01 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.6-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Adjusted phase calculations to precisely match definitions: Full moon is
    100%, new moon is 0 %, 1st/3rd quarter are 50%.  As a result, the
    icons/labels are only present for a few hours, but overall it's
    mathematically correct!
  * Added additional information to the menu including next phases and the
    next solstice and equinox.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 3 Aug 2012 8:58:31 +1000

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 25 Jul 2012 20:50:52 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.3-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added distance from earth/sun and constellation information to the menu.
  * Updated main icon to be a crescent.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 24 Jul 2012 9:55:08 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.2-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added a generic icon to appear in the menu and unity search.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 24 Jul 2012 8:05:18 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.1-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changed update rate to be hourly.

indicator-lunar (1.0.0-1) precise; urgency=low

  * First release.
