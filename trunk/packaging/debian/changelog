indicator-on-this-day (1.0.9-1) xenial; urgency=low

  * On computer startup when the indicator is set to autostart,
    sometimes the indicator can become unresponsive.
    The end user can set the property

        X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=120

    in

        ~/.config/autostart/indicator-lunar.py.desktop

    to delay the indicator startup (for two minutes) avoiding the issue.
    For new installations, by default, the value is set to zero.
  * Removed the preference for autostart.
    To change indicator autostart (off or on), open the file

        ~/.config/autostart/indicator-lunar.py.desktop

    and add/edit the setting to either

        X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true

    or

        X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false

    Alternatively, add the indicator using Startup Applications.
    For new installations, by default, autostart will be set to true.
