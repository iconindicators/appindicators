  * Changed text/tooltip for checkbox to open a PPA in a browser.

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.26-1) precise; urgency=low

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.25-1) precise; urgency=low

    the user so the user can uncombine PPAs to see individual messages.
  * Added all series of Ubuntu (including those no longer supported).
  * Only create the log file when needed.
    Thanks to dvrc (dvrc.contact@gmail.com).

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 17 Jan 2013 16:30:00 +1000


indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.18-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Using threads for each statistic sometimes results in the package names
    being out of (alphabetical) order...now fixed.
  * Added logging to exceptions.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 20 Dec 2012 13:17:50 +1000

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.16-1) precise; urgency=low

  * When PPAs were combined, the "no information" message was shown regardless
    if the situation was no information or an error in downloading the PPA.
  * Removed natty from the list of PPAs.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 1 Dec 2012 11:44:24 +1000


indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Modified the download counts for architecture independent binary packages.
    If a binary package exists in two (or more) places but has different
    versions, the download count for each binary package is counted (for the
    first instance of a given version number).  This means that different
    versions are treated as separate packages but are still combined under
    the common name.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 27 Nov 2012 22:28:25 +1000


indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Add a combine PPA option which combines the statistics when the PPA
    user/name are the same.
    If a published binary is architecture specific (such as compiled C), the
    download count is summed across all instances of that published binary.
    If a published binary is not architecture specific (such as Python), the
    download count is not summed (as it is assumed to be the same binary).
    The version number is retained only if it is identical across all
    instances of a published binary.

  * Swapped out python-appindicator for gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 in

    more enviroments.

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.10-1) precise; urgency=low

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 24 Oct 2012 22:40:33 +1000


indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.9-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Constant removing/adding of menu items was leaking memory, so combined
    menu build/rebuild methods.  Still get the (presumed benign) warning
    "Trying to remove a child that doesn't believe we're it's parent"
    warning.
  * Now logs in once to LaunchPad - each login uses an excessive amount of
    memory.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sun, 26 Aug 2012 16:02:52 +1000
