indicator-lunar (1.0.10-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changes for Python3 (but still runs as Python2) and PyGObject.
    Have to run as Python 2 since PPA won't/can't build a Python 3 version of Ephem.
  * Switched back to using localtime!
  * Added option to start the werewolf warning at a particular illumination.
  * Using the PyEphem list of cities with latitude/longitude/elevation information,
    now displays sun/moon/planet data such as rise and set times.

indicator-lunar (1.0.9-1) precise; urgency=low

    to localtime (ephem.localtime) and got better/closer reality.

indicator-lunar (1.0.8-1) precise; urgency=low

indicator-lunar (1.0.6-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Adjusted phase calculations to precisely match definitions: Full moon is 100%,
    new moon is 0 %, 1st/3rd quarter are 50%.  As a result, the icons/labels are
    only present for a few hours, but overall it's mathematically correct!
  * Added additional information to the menu including next phases and the next
    solstice and equinox.
