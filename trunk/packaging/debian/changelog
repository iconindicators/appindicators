indicator-virtual-box (1.0.20-1) precise; urgency=low

  * In Ubuntu 13.10 the initial value set by the spinner adjustment was not
    appearing in the spinner field. Need to force the initial value by explicitly
    setting it.

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.18-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Only brings up one VirtualBox manager at a time.
  * User can customise the launch command for a VM, allowing VBoxHeadless to be
    used instead of VBoxManage.
  * User can set a VM to automatically start when the indicator starts.  Each VM
    will start up before the indicator displays, with a five second delay between
    each VM.
  * Now logs to a file in the user's HOME directory.
  * Attempt to bring about/preferences to front.

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.16-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added python3-gi to debian/control Depends (for Precise support).
  * Swapped out python-appindicator for gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 in debian/control
    Depends.
  * Simpler handling for creating the indicator - should hopefully sustain more
    enviroments.

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changes for Python3 and PyGObject.
  * Now supports VirtualBox 4.2 and specifically groups.
  * Handle the case when VirtualBox is not installed.
  * Handle the case when VirtualBox is installed but has not yet been run
    (and so $HOME/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml does not exist).
  * Moved the preferences into a tabbed view.
  * Now uses a radio button to indicate a running VM as standard.
    Removed the (legacy) show text before/after a VM.
  * Added option to show text before/after a group name.
  * Known issue: If a VM exists in a group (and there is another VM of the same name
    but not in a group) and you ungroup, the VM in the group is not removed from the
    group.  This appears to be a bug in the VirtualBox UI and as such the indicator
    displays the VM (from the group) alongside the other VMs.

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Addresses the case in which a VM which has been renamed/deleted and is selected 
    in the menu but a refresh has not occurred.

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.13-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed the menu (incorrectly initialised) which caused a crash under GTK (non Unity).
  * Removed duplicate preferences menu item.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 25 Aug 2012 11:22:02 +1000


indicator-virtual-box (1.0.12-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Noted that memory was leaking - strongly suspect it was due to removing/adding
    menu items on each update.  As a result, the menu is now completely rebuilt on 
    each update.  Unfortunately, if the preferences/about dialogs are showing
    during an update, the warning "Trying to remove a child that doesn't believe
    we're it's parent" is emitted, which appears to be benign.

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.11-1) precise; urgency=low

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.10-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed the PPA URL in the About dialog.
  * Consolidated all options into a preferences dialog.
  * Default sort now matches that given by the VirtualBox UI (rather than VBoxManage).
  * The update of the running status of the VMs in the menu is now configurable 
    between 1 and 60 minutes.  Note that an update also occurs each time a VM
    is started and when the preferences dialog is ok'd/cancelled.
  * Big thanks to Pascal De Vuyst (https://launchpad.net/~pascal-devuyst) for
    suggestions/patches for preferences and sorting!

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.9-1) precise; urgency=low

    front (using wmctrl).
  * Removed the refresh menu item.  The list of VMs in the menu are now
    automatically refreshed every 15 minutes.
  * Fixed an issue where the indicator believes a VM is running but is in fact not.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 16 Jul 2012 14:36:10 +1000


indicator-virtual-box (1.0.6-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Hide the menu during refresh (using popdown). 
  * Renamed menu item 'Frontend' to be 'VirtualBox'...makes more sense.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 13 Jul 2012 23:18:16 +1000

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.3-1) precise; urgency=low

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.2-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Unity appindicator does not support stying in the menu items.
    To indicate a running VM "---" is placed either side of the VM name.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 7 Jul 2012 18:59:21 +1000


indicator-virtual-box (1.0.1-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The bold/italic tags are not being rendered in the menu to indicate a
    running VM.  For now, will use "---" either side of the VM name.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 7 Jul 2012 12:38:10 +1000


indicator-virtual-box (1.0.0-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Tested on Ubuntu but should work for Lubuntu/Xubuntu.
  * Lubuntu/Xubuntu:
     User needs to manually remove spurious directory: /usr/share/icons/elementary/status/48/untitled
     then rebuild the image cache: sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/elementary
  * If 'Gtk Warning: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap"' appears on execution,
    install "sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf".
  * The indicator will run without 'virtualbox' installed...but it'll do nothing useful!
