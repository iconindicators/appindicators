indicator-lunar (1.0.58-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: The Icon Text tag list in the Preferences dialog was missing the
    Tropical Sign tag for stars and all tags for planetary moons.
  * Bug fix: The Right Ascension in degrees was incorrect for all objects.
  * Bug fix: The Bright Limb angle calculation was erroneous due to mixing of
    degrees and radians!
  * Bug fix: When the moon never rises, the icon generation failed (no bright
    limb value was calculated).  
  * Added distance to Earth in kilometres for the Moon's menu item.    
  * Added timeouts to the TLE/OE download.
  * Added caching of TLE/OE downloaded data to avoid over-taxing the
    respective data sources.
  * Added warnings to some tooltips about having too many bodies might slow
    down the indicator.
  * Removed outdated eclipse data.
  * Removed redundant functions to convert hours/minutes/seconds and
    degrees/minutes/seconds to decimal degrees as PyEphem does it for free!

indicator-lunar (1.0.57-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: The last update for satellite TLE data and orbital element data
    was not being set to the current time after an update.
  * Bug fix: In the Preferences, if a bad URL for satellite TLE data or
    orbital element data was entered, the resulting bad data was carried
    through to the indicator proper.
  * Option to automatically add new satellites and/or orbital elements from
    the respective data source.
  * Changed astronomical unit abbreviation from AU to ua to keep in line with
    SI (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-SI_units_mentioned_in_the_SI).
  * Dynamically created icons, such as
      the full moon notification when testing in the preferences;
      the indicator icon which changes according to the current
      lunar illumination percentage;
    are now saved to the /tmp directory (or equivalent).
  * Eclipse type information uses a class, so no longer reliant on strings.
  * Internationalisation.  Many thanks to Oleg Moiseichuk who was instrumental
    in this miracle!
  * Added Russian translation.  Thanks to Oleg Moiseichuk. 
  * About dialog changed to accept translator information.
  * Overhaul of repository structure and build script.

indicator-lunar (1.0.53-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: When checking (adding) a planet in the preferences, the
    magnitude, right ascension, declination, azimuth and altitude were
    omitted from indicator text tags table.
  * Bug fix: When checking (adding) a star in the preferences, the
    constellation, rise time and set time were omitted from indicator text
    tags table.

  * Planets/stars which 'never rise' can now be hidden.
  * The TLE data source may be specified as a URL (including local file).
  * Removed the satellite subsequent pass information as it slowed down the
    update of the indicator (noticable when many satellites are checked).
  * When showing only visible passes, satellites which are circumpolar or
    'always up' are included, despite not actually transiting.
  * Added Tropical Sign to stars.
  * Added attributes of the major moons to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.

indicator-lunar (1.0.50-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Handle 'add_credit_section' on Ubuntu 12.04 (was causing a
    segmentation fault).
  * Bug fix: Using the same name for the icon causes the icon to appear the
    same and so appindicator (or something) decides not to reload the icon.
    The workaround is to alternate the icon name on each refresh.

  * Bug fix: When switching to show visible satellite passes to show all
    passes, data for the visibility was not initialised.
  * Moved magnitude from the RA/Dec section to the main section as magnitude
    has nothing to do with location.
  * Added the azimuth to the satellite notification.

  * Bright limb angle was sometimes negative and needed to be "folded" into
    the correct quadrant by adding 360.
  * Changed the RA/Dec calculations in the bright limb to use Apparent
    Geocentric Position as this gives a closer value to that calculated by
    Meeus.
  * Added RA/Dec to sun and planetary bodies.
  * Thanks to Alan Eliasen (http://futureboy.us) for bright limb and RA/Dec.

indicator-lunar (1.0.31-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Removed the option to run using GTKStatusIcon.
    When enabled and the indicator was run on a system which supports
    AppIndicator3, the icon would not appear.

  * Increased the size of the werewolf summary/body text fields.
  * Modified the Tropical Sign function to use a copy of the body as
    downstream calculations were getting trashed.
  * Put in a preference to use GTKStatusIcon instead of AppIndicator.
    On Lubuntu 12.04 it was found that AppIndicator would be created but the
    tooltip would not render.  This preference lets the user fall back to GTK.

indicator-lunar (1.0.25-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The notification text (summary and body) is now configurable.
  * The full moon screen notification is no longer fixed to hourly.
    The indicator updates according to the next date/time for any object's
    rise/set/phase change.  Therefore the full moon notification may occur
    more frequently than hourly.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 21 Aug 2013 16:29:13 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.24-1) precise; urgency=low

    update with the correct amount.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 2 Aug 2013 9:06:18 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.23-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The update sometimes occurred slightly earlier than when appropriate,
    likely due to truncating a float to int.  

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 31 Jul 2013 10:11:13 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.22-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug: GLib.timeout_add_seconds() requires an integer for the time
    value.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 8 Jul 2013 8:06:20 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.21-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Only updates when the next rise/set/phase/etc is due.
  * Only create the log file when needed.

    Lubuntu/Xubuntu.
  * Icons for Preferences/About now show for Lubuntu/Xubuntu.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 10 Apr 2013 11:17:21 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.18-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Replaced deprecated GObject calls with GLib.
  * Fixed a bug: if a city (from the timezone) was not found, the default
    crashed.  Also added a feature to strip "_" from timezones such as
    America/New_York.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 5 Feb 2013 17:16:54 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.17-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Ensured all calculations are based from the same date/time.
  * Added constellation/distance information to sun menu item. 
  * Added spacing to all menu items.
  * Adjusted each SVG such that the image is horizontally centred and has the
    same left/right margin for each image.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 13 Dec 2012 16:11:23 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.16-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added indent for next moon phases.
  * Consolidate the first and third quarter SVG functions.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 29 Nov 2012 12:47:07 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The next phases of the moon were being dropped out before the phase
    actually arrived!

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 28 Nov 2012 8:51:47 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now creates the lunar phase icon on the fly for each percentage of
    illumination!
  * Works on Ubuntu 12.04/12.10 and Lubuntu 12.10.  
    Untested on Xubuntu 12.04/12.10.
  * On Lubuntu 12.04, the icon fails to update, the icon label/tooltip does
    not display and menu separators look odd.  This occurs because
    AppIndicator3 successfully creates the indicator but then quietly fails to
    update the icon and so on.  The fix is to put in an override (to use GTK
    indicator)...which will only be done if a user screams for it.
    No idea if this occurs on Xubuntu 12.04.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 26 Nov 2012 10:01:40 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.13-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now runs as Python 3 and requires python3-ephem (from same PPA).
  * Kept getting GTK missing child warnings so put menu update back to how it
    was.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:50:07 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.12-1) precise; urgency=low

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 19 Nov 2012 16:43:09 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.11-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added python3-gi to debian/control Depends (for Precise support).
  * Swapped out python-appindicator for gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 in
    debian/control Depends.
  * Simpler handling for creating the indicator - should hopefully sustain
    more environments.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 16 Nov 2012 10:26:05 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.10-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changes for Python3 (but still runs as Python2) and PyGObject.
    Have to run as Python 2 since PPA won't/can't build a Python 3 version of
    Ephem.
  * Switched back to using localtime!
  * Added option to start the werewolf warning at a particular illumination.
  * Using the PyEphem list of cities with latitude/longitude/elevation
    information, now displays sun/moon/planet data such as rise and set times.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 22 Oct 2012 21:24:49 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.9-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Noticed the dates for next phases were out by hours/days.  Removed the
    conversion to localtime (ephem.localtime) and got better/closer reality.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 9 Aug 2012 20:10:27 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.8-1) precise; urgency=low

indicator-lunar (1.0.7-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Handle the case where the directory ~/.config/autostart does not exist.
  * Increased the indent of the submenu items by one space.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 7 Aug 2012 22:40:01 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.6-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Adjusted phase calculations to precisely match definitions: Full moon is
    100%, new moon is 0 %, 1st/3rd quarter are 50%.  As a result, the
    icons/labels are only present for a few hours, but overall it's
    mathematically correct!
  * Added additional information to the menu including next phases and the
    next solstice and equinox.
