indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.48-1) precise; urgency=low

  * GTK.AboutDialog now uses a Stack rather than Notebook to hold the
    underlying widgets.  Rather than try to (constantly) reverse engineer
    the GTK.AboutDialog to retrofit the changelog tab, the default
    GTK.AboutDialog is used with a hyperlink to the changelog inserted.

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.26-1) precise; urgency=low

    the user so the user can uncombine PPAs to see individual messages.
  * Added all series of Ubuntu (including those no longer supported).
  * Only create the log file when needed.
    Thanks to Rafael Cavalcanti <rafael.kavalkanti@gmail.com>.

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Modified the download counts for architecture independent binary packages.
    If a binary package exists in two (or more) places but has different
    versions, the download count for each binary package is counted (for the
    first instance of a given version number).  This means that different
    versions are treated as separate packages but are still combined under
    the common name.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 27 Nov 2012 22:28:25 +1000


indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Add a combine PPA option which combines the statistics when the PPA
    user/name are the same.
    If a published binary is architecture specific (such as compiled C), the
    download count is summed across all instances of that published binary.
    If a published binary is not architecture specific (such as Python), the
    download count is not summed (as it is assumed to be the same binary).
    The version number is retained only if it is identical across all
    instances of a published binary.

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.9-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Constant removing/adding of menu items was leaking memory, so combined
    menu build/rebuild methods.  Still get the (presumed benign) warning
    "Trying to remove a child that doesn't believe we're it's parent"
    warning.
  * Now logs in once to LaunchPad - each login uses an excessive amount of
    memory.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sun, 26 Aug 2012 16:02:52 +1000
