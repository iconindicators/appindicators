indicator-lunar (1.0.23-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The update sometimes occurred slightly earlier than when appropriate, likely
    due to truncating a float to int.

indicator-lunar (1.0.22-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now logs to a file in the user's HOME directory.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 4 May 2013 1:34:14 +1000

    Also added a feature to strip "_" from timezones such as America/New_York.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 5 Feb 2013 17:16:54 +1000

  * Added constellation/distance information to sun menu item. 
  * Added spacing to all menu items.
  * Adjusted each SVG such that the image is horizontally centred and has the same

indicator-lunar (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The next phases of the moon were being dropped out before the phase actually
    arrived!

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 28 Nov 2012 8:51:47 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now creates the lunar phase icon on the fly for each percentage of illumination!
  * Works on Ubuntu 12.04/12.10 and Lubuntu 12.10.  Untested on Xubuntu 12.04/12.10.
  * On Lubuntu 12.04, the icon fails to update, the icon label/tooltip does not
    display and menu seperators look odd.  This occurs because AppIndicator3
    successfully creates the indicator but then quietly fails to update the icon and
    so on.  The fix is to put in an override (to use GTK indicator)...which will
    only be done if a user screams for it.  No idea if this occurs on Xubuntu 12.04.

indicator-lunar (1.0.13-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now runs as Python 3 and requires python3-ephem (from same PPA).

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:50:07 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.12-1) precise; urgency=low

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 19 Nov 2012 16:43:09 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.11-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added python3-gi to debian/control Depends (for Precise support).
  * Swapped out python-appindicator for gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 in debian/control
    Depends.
  * Simpler handling for creating the indicator - should hopefully sustain more
    enviroments. 

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 16 Nov 2012 10:26:05 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.10-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changes for Python3 (but still runs as Python2) and PyGObject.
    Have to run as Python 2 since PPA won't/can't build a Python 3 version of Ephem.
  * Switched back to using localtime!
  * Added option to start the werewolf warning at a particular illumination.
  * Using the PyEphem list of cities with latitude/longitude/elevation information,
    now displays sun/moon/planet data such as rise and set times.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 22 Oct 2012 21:24:49 +1000

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 7 Aug 2012 22:40:01 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.6-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Adjusted phase calculations to precisely match definitions: Full moon is 100%,
    new moon is 0 %, 1st/3rd quarter are 50%.  As a result, the icons/labels are
    only present for a few hours, but overall it's mathematically correct!
  * Added additional information to the menu including next phases and the next
    solstice and equinox.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 3 Aug 2012 8:58:31 +1000
