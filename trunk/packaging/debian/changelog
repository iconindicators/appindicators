indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Modified the download counts for architecture independent binary packages.
    If a binary package exists in two (or more) places but has different versions,
    the download count for each binary package is counted (for the first instance
    of a given version number).  This means that different versions are treated as
    separate packages but are still combined under the common name.

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Add a combine PPA option which combines the statistics when the PPA user/name
    are the same.
    If a published binary is architecture specific (such as compiled C), the
    download count is summed across all instances of that published binary.
    If a published binary is not architecture specific (such as Python), the
    download count is not summed (as it is assumed to be the same binary).
    The version number is retained only if it is identical across all instances of
    a published binary.

indicator-ppa-download-statistics (1.0.9-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Constant removing/adding of menu items was leaking memory, so combined menu
    build/rebuild methods.  Still get the (presumed benign) warning "Trying to 
    remove a child that doesn't believe we're it's parent" warning.
  * Now logs in once to LaunchPad - each login uses an excessive amount of memory.
