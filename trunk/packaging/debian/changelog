indicator-tide (1.0.8-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Tidal readings are now displayed based on the date/time:
      If all of a port's readings contain both date and time, each reading is
      converted to user local date/time.
      If at least one of a port's readings is missing the time, all of the
      readings are shown in port local date/time (as per original source).
  * Corrected warnings in .desktop file.
  * Changed the format of the tide type, time and level to have the type first
    (rather than time first) to match the data source.
  * Added a preference to format the display when time is absent from a reading.
  * Split the Preferences dialog over two tabs (ports and general).
  * About/Preferences dialogs now block each other - only show one at a time.
  * User settings now stored in the directory specified by the environment
    variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME, or, if not present, $HOME/.config
    (existing user settings stored in $HOME are migrated to the new location).
  * Update release to trusty as precise is end of life.

indicator-tide (1.0.5-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Now uses the X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled tag for autostart.
  * Updated UKHO port data to 2016/2017 listing.
    The UKHO port data is split into two parts - UK ports, which does not
    expire and non-UK ports for which data expires annually.
    If the license date is exceeded, only the UK ports will be available.
  * Now displays the country next to the port city/town.
  * Shows a notification if the tidal information could not be obtained.
  * Added an option to show the first day's tidal information in full and
    subsequent days as submenus - useful for small screens.
  * By default, tidal data is displayed as submenus, except for the first day.
  * The daylight savings offset is now automatically calculated (based on the
    computer's time zone and DST tables).
    The user preference has been removed.
  * Fixed PyGIWarnings on imports.
  * Overhaul of icons: only the hicolor icon is required and all theme icons
    are created from the hicolor via the build script.
  * Overhaul of build script: extracted common functions into a separate
    script used by all indicators.
