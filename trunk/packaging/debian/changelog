indicator-lunar (1.0.36-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changed checking of Gtk.ResponseType.CANCEL to Gtk.ResponseType.OK
    as it was possible to simulate Gtk.ResponseType.OK by hitting the escape
    key.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 1 Mar 2014 9:55:18 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.35-1) precise; urgency=low

indicator-lunar (1.0.33-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bright limb angle was sometimes negative and needed to be "folded" into
    the correct quadrant by adding 360.
  * Changed the RA/Dec calculations in the bright limb to use Apparent
    Geocentric Position as this gives a closer value to that calculated by
    Meeus.
  * Added RA/Dec to sun and planetary bodies.
  * Thanks to Alan Eliasen (http://futureboy.us) for bright limb and RA/Dec.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 18 Dec 2013 20:23:11 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.32-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Created a new About dialog showing the changelog.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 16 Dec 2013 23:57:41 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.31-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Removed the option to run using GTKStatusIcon.
    When enabled and the indicator was run on a system which supports
    AppIndicator3, the icon would not appear.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sun, 15 Dec 2013 15:37:43 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.30-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Updated the About dialog to use Gtk+ 3.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sun, 15 Dec 2013 11:47:37 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.29-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added the bright limb angle for the moon and planets.  Thanks to
    'Astronomical Algorithms' by Jean Meeus (and JÃ¼rgen Giesen for pointers).
  * The icon is now rotated to reflect the bright limb angle (and reality).
  * The icon text (the tooltip for GTKStatusIcon) is configurable.
  * Changed the control file 'Depends' from Python to Python3.
  * Increased the size of the werewolf summary/body text fields.
  * Modified the Tropical Sign function to use a copy of the body as
    downstream calculations were getting trashed.
  * Put in a preference to use GTKStatusIcon instead of AppIndicator.
    On Lubuntu 12.04 it was found that AppIndicator would be created but the
    tooltip would not render.  This preference lets the user fall back to GTK.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 2 Dec 2013 16:43:23 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.28-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added the upcoming solar/lunar eclipse (until 2099).
    Thanks to Fred Espenak and Jean Meeus and NASA!
  * Updated About dialog to reflect various authors and shoulders of giants.
  * In Ubuntu 13.10 the initial value set by the spinner adjustment
    (for illumination %) was not appearing in the spinner field.
    Need to force the initial value by explicitly setting it.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 24 Oct 2013 20:32:13 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.27-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Displays the tropical sign for each planetary body calculated at midnight
    UTC.  Useful for the astrological enthusiast.
    Thanks to Ignius Drake (elespector@gmail.com) for the code!

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 17 Oct 2013 20:16:33 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.26-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Put in a test button to show the notification text.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 28 Aug 2013 20:22:21 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.25-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The notification text (summary and body) is now configurable.
  * The full moon screen notification is no longer fixed to hourly.
    The indicator updates according to the next date/time for any object's
    rise/set/phase change.  Therefore the full moon notification may occur
    more frequently than hourly.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 21 Aug 2013 16:29:13 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.24-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed another update bug: the timeout call was not being refreshed on each
    update with the correct amount.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 2 Aug 2013 9:06:18 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.23-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The update sometimes occurred slightly earlier than when appropriate,
    likely due to truncating a float to int.  

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 31 Jul 2013 10:11:13 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.22-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug: GLib.timeout_add_seconds() requires an integer for the time
    value.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 8 Jul 2013 8:06:20 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.21-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Only updates when the next rise/set/phase/etc is due.
  * Only create the log file when needed.
    Thanks to Rafael Cavalcanti <rafael.kavalkanti@gmail.com>.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 5 Jul 2013 20:17:12 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.20-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Seems the bug fixed to handle a missing city was not quite fixed!
  * Now logs to a file in the user's HOME directory.
  * Attempt to bring about/preferences to front.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Sat, 4 May 2013 1:34:14 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.19-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Revised the icons to fill in a square boundary - no longer stretched on
    Lubuntu/Xubuntu.
  * Icons for Preferences/About now show for Lubuntu/Xubuntu.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 10 Apr 2013 11:17:21 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.18-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Replaced deprecated GObject calls with GLib.
  * Fixed a bug: if a city (from the timezone) was not found, the default
    crashed.  Also added a feature to strip "_" from timezones such as
    America/New_York.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 5 Feb 2013 17:16:54 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.17-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Ensured all calculations are based from the same date/time.
  * Added constellation/distance information to sun menu item. 
  * Added spacing to all menu items.
  * Adjusted each SVG such that the image is horizontally centred and has the
    same left/right margin for each image.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 13 Dec 2012 16:11:23 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.16-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added indent for next moon phases.
  * Consolidate the first and third quarter SVG functions.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 29 Nov 2012 12:47:07 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * The next phases of the moon were being dropped out before the phase
    actually arrived!

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 28 Nov 2012 8:51:47 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now creates the lunar phase icon on the fly for each percentage of
    illumination!
  * Works on Ubuntu 12.04/12.10 and Lubuntu 12.10.  
    Untested on Xubuntu 12.04/12.10.
  * On Lubuntu 12.04, the icon fails to update, the icon label/tooltip does
    not display and menu separators look odd.  This occurs because
    AppIndicator3 successfully creates the indicator but then quietly fails to
    update the icon and so on.  The fix is to put in an override (to use GTK
    indicator)...which will only be done if a user screams for it.
    No idea if this occurs on Xubuntu 12.04.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 26 Nov 2012 10:01:40 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.13-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Now runs as Python 3 and requires python3-ephem (from same PPA).
  * Kept getting GTK missing child warnings so put menu update back to how it
    was.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:50:07 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.12-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changed how the update/menu was kicked off in the preferences.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 19 Nov 2012 16:43:09 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.11-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added python3-gi to debian/control Depends (for Precise support).
  * Swapped out python-appindicator for gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 in
    debian/control Depends.
  * Simpler handling for creating the indicator - should hopefully sustain
    more environments.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 16 Nov 2012 10:26:05 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.10-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changes for Python3 (but still runs as Python2) and PyGObject.
    Have to run as Python 2 since PPA won't/can't build a Python 3 version of
    Ephem.
  * Switched back to using localtime!
  * Added option to start the werewolf warning at a particular illumination.
  * Using the PyEphem list of cities with latitude/longitude/elevation
    information, now displays sun/moon/planet data such as rise and set times.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 22 Oct 2012 21:24:49 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.9-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Noticed the dates for next phases were out by hours/days.  Removed the
    conversion to localtime (ephem.localtime) and got better/closer reality.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 9 Aug 2012 20:10:27 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.8-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug where the phase and illumination did not match due to
    rounding error.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Thu, 9 Aug 2012 19:22:09 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.7-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Handle the case where the directory ~/.config/autostart does not exist.
  * Increased the indent of the submenu items by one space.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 7 Aug 2012 22:40:01 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.6-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Adjusted phase calculations to precisely match definitions: Full moon is
    100%, new moon is 0 %, 1st/3rd quarter are 50%.  As a result, the
    icons/labels are only present for a few hours, but overall it's
    mathematically correct!
  * Added additional information to the menu including next phases and the
    next solstice and equinox.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 3 Aug 2012 8:58:31 +1000

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 25 Jul 2012 20:50:52 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.3-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added distance from earth/sun and constellation information to the menu.
  * Updated main icon to be a crescent.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 24 Jul 2012 9:55:08 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.2-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added a generic icon to appear in the menu and unity search.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 24 Jul 2012 8:05:18 +1000


indicator-lunar (1.0.1-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changed update rate to be hourly.
