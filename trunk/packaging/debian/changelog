indicator-script-runner (1.0.16-1) bionic; urgency=low

  * Background script functionality added.  Existing scripts are now referred
    to as non-background scripts and remain functionally as they were.

    A background script contains a command/script, just as a non-background
    script.  Rather than direct execution by the user through the menu, a
    background script is run at a specified interval (in minutes), similarly
    to cron.  The background script must be added to the icon text for the
    script to be run.

    Example: If a background script computes the amount of free memory, the
    text output will always be non-empty.  Enabling the sound and notification
    options for the script are of no value.

    Example: If a background script checks for the presence of a log file (the
    log file representing an exception condition), the script will produce no
    text output if the log file is absent, yet produce non-empty text output if
    the log file is present.  Enabling the sound and notification options for
    the script are of value.

    Each background script is updated according to its respective interval and
	only if the background script has been added to the icon text.  The result
    of the background script is cached and the icon text is updated.

    As background scripts may have different update intervals, one script may
    update and another script will not.  The icon text will be updated using
    both the immediate result from the script which updated and the cached
    result from scripts which did not update (at that time).  If one script
    updates every five minutes and another script updates hourly, the result
    shown in the icon text for the hourly script may be stale due to the
    cached result.  Consequently, a script can be optionally forced to update
    quicker than its specified interval.  This option would typically be used
    for a script which reports exception conditions.

indicator-script-runner (1.0.14-1) bionic; urgency=low

  * Removed the directory attribute from scripts.
    Any script which had a directory specified now has that value prepended to
    the corresponding command attribute.
    If a directory need be specified for a (new) script, prepend the following
    to the command:
        "cd /the/directory/you/want ; "
  * Update release to bionic as xenial is end of life.

indicator-script-runner (1.0.13-1) xenial; urgency=low

  * On computer startup when the indicator is set to autostart,
    sometimes the indicator can become unresponsive.
    The end user can set the property

        X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=120

    in

        ~/.config/autostart/indicator-lunar.py.desktop

    to delay the indicator startup (for two minutes) avoiding the issue.
    For new installations, by default, the value is set to zero.
  * Removed the preference for autostart.
    To change indicator autostart (off or on), open the file

        ~/.config/autostart/indicator-lunar.py.desktop

    and add/edit the setting to either

        X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true

    or

        X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false

    Alternatively, add the indicator using Startup Applications.
    For new installations, by default, autostart will be set to true.

  * Handle the deprecation of the -e option in gnome-terminal and simplify.
    Consequently, gnome-terminal is used (rather than x-terminal-emulator),
    /bin/bash is used (rather than $SHELL) and any text (used for example in
    the notifications) may need to be checked for correct escape characters.
  * Removed user config migration code.

indicator-script-runner (1.0.6-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * When a script was removed, the next script selected would be from the
    first script of the first group, rather than the first script of the same
    group, causing confusion when deleting multiple scripts.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 22 Jan 2018 14:47:10 +1000


indicator-script-runner (1.0.5-1) trusty; urgency=low

indicator-script-runner (1.0.4-1) trusty; urgency=low

    ubuntu-mono-light would not load due to directories not present in the
    underlying index.theme file.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 6 Oct 2017 12:19:16 +1000

indicator-script-runner (1.0.2-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Now uses the X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled tag for autostart.
  * One script can be marked as 'default' and will be executed upon a middle
    mouse click of the indicator icon.
  * Each script can optionally play a generic sound and/or display a generic
    notification upon completion.
  * Updated the sample scripts to use the generic sound/notification where
    relevant.
  * Renamed 'name' to 'group' and 'description' to 'name' to better describe
    scripts and their groupings.  Renamed internally many settings - as a
    result, some user settings may be reset to default.

  * Fixed PyGIWarnings on imports.
  * Overhaul of icons: only the hicolor icon is required and all theme icons
    are created from the hicolor via the build script.
