indicator-tide (1.0.5-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Now uses the X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled tag for autostart.
  * Updated UKHO port data to 2016/2017 listing.
  * The UKHO port data is split into two parts - UK ports, which does not
    expire and non-UK ports for which data expires annually.
    If the license date is exceeded, only the UK ports will be available.
  * Now displays the country next to the port city/town.
  * Shows a notification if the tidal information could not be obtained.
  * Added an option to show the first day's tidal information in full and
    subsequent days as submenus - useful for small screens.
  * By default, tidal data is displayed as submenus, except for the first day.
  * The daylight savings offset is now automatically calculated (based on the
    computer's time zone and DST tables).  The user preference has been
    removed.
  * Fixed PyGIWarnings on imports.
  * Overhaul of icons: only the hicolor icon is required and all theme icons
    are created from the hicolor via the build script.
  * Overhaul of build script: extracted common functions into a separate
    script used by all indicators.
