indicator-on-this-day (1.0.4-1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Tidy up load config of user preferences.
  * Added a hyperlink to the About dialog which links to the error log
    text file (only visible if the underlying file is present).
  * About dialog now pulls the changelog directly from /usr/doc rather than a
    local copy in the installation directory.
  * Update release to xenial as trusty is end of life.
  * Update debian/control Standards-Version to 3.9.7.
