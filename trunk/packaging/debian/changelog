indicator-script-runner (1.0.7-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Handle the deprecation of the -e option in gnome-terminal and simplify.
    Consequently, gnome-terminal is used (rather than x-terminal-emulator),
    /bin/bash is used (rather than $SHELL) and any text (used for example in
    the notifications) may need to be checked for correct escape characters.
  * Removed user config migration code.

indicator-script-runner (1.0.6-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * When a script was removed, the next script selected would be from the
    first script of the first group, rather than the first script of the same
    group, causing confusion when deleting multiple scripts.

indicator-script-runner (1.0.5-1) trusty; urgency=low

    resulting in incorrect script group indexes being selected in the
    Preferences.

indicator-script-runner (1.0.4-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: In Ubuntu 16.04 and greater, icons for ubuntu-mono-dark and
    ubuntu-mono-light would not load due to directories not present in the
    underlying index.theme file.

indicator-script-runner (1.0.3-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Updates we're being called twice!
  * Corrected warnings in .desktop file.
  * Added option to only show script names when scripts are shown grouped.
  * About/Preferences dialogs now block each other - only show one at a time.
  * User settings now stored in the directory specified by the environment
    variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME, or, if not present, $HOME/.config
    (existing user settings stored in $HOME are migrated to the new location).

indicator-script-runner (1.0.2-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: Now uses the X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled tag for autostart.
  * One script can be marked as 'default' and will be executed upon a middle
    mouse click of the indicator icon.
  * Each script can optionally play a generic sound and/or display a generic
    notification upon completion.
  * Updated the sample scripts to use the generic sound/notification where
    relevant.
  * Renamed 'name' to 'group' and 'description' to 'name' to better describe
    scripts and their groupings.  Renamed internally many settings - as a
    result, some user settings may be reset to default.
  * Added utf-8 encoding line.
  * Fixed PyGIWarnings on imports.
  * Overhaul of icons: only the hicolor icon is required and all theme icons
    are created from the hicolor via the build script.
  * Overhaul of build script: extracted common functions into a separate
    script used by all indicators.
