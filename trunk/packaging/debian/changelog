indicator-virtual-box (1.0.61-1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: The executable for VirtualBox may have a different path
    to that which is ultimately displayed in a process list, rendering the fix
    in the previous version to show the VirtualBox Manager window useless.
    Instead, add a text field and the user manually specifies the window name.
  * Corrected the indents for menu items for GNOME Shell.
  * Tidy up load config of user preferences.
  * Added hyperlink to the About dialog which links to the error log text file
    (only visible if the underlying file is present).
  * About dialog now pulls the changelog directly from /usr/doc
    rather than a local copy in the installation directory.
  * Update release to xenial as trusty is end of life.
  * Update debian/control Standards-Version to 3.9.7.

    VBoxManage was not in fact installed!
  * Bug fix: If VBoxManage was not installed the Preferences dialog crashed.
  * GTK.AboutDialog now uses a Stack rather than Notebook to hold the
    underlying widgets.  Rather than try to (constantly) reverse engineer
    the GTK.AboutDialog to retrofit the changelog tab, the default
    GTK.AboutDialog is used with a hyperlink to the changelog inserted.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Wed, 20 May 2015 23:37:11 +1000


indicator-virtual-box (1.0.41-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: When autostarting a VM (or VMs), the time delay of 5 seconds
    after the VM is started and before updating the menu was insufficient when

    identify running VMs.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Mon, 18 May 2015 16:13:04 +1000

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.29-1) precise; urgency=low

    Each VM will start up before the indicator displays, with a five second
    delay between each VM.

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.16-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added python3-gi to debian/control Depends (for Precise support).
  * Swapped out python-appindicator for gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 in
    debian/control Depends.
  * Simpler handling for creating the indicator - should hopefully sustain
    more environments.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 16 Nov 2012 10:26:05 +1000


indicator-virtual-box (1.0.15-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changes for Python3 and PyGObject.
  * Now supports VirtualBox 4.2 and specifically groups.
  * Handle the case when VirtualBox is not installed.
  * Handle the case when VirtualBox is installed but has not yet been run
    (and so $HOME/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml does not exist).
  * Moved the preferences into a tabbed view.
  * Now uses a radio button to indicate a running VM as standard.
    Removed the (legacy) show text before/after a VM.
  * Added option to show text before/after a group name.
  * Known issue: If a VM exists in a group (and there is another VM of the
    same name but not in a group) and you ungroup, the VM in the group is
    not removed from the group.  This appears to be a bug in the VirtualBox
    UI and as such the indicator displays the VM (from the group) alongside
    the other VMs.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Tue, 6 Nov 2012 18:45:52 +1000


indicator-virtual-box (1.0.14-1) precise; urgency=low

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.12-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Noted that memory was leaking - strongly suspect it was due to
    removing/adding menu items on each update.  As a result, the menu is now
    completely rebuilt on each update.  Unfortunately, if the
    preferences/about dialogs are showing during an update, the warning
    "Trying to remove a child that doesn't believe we're it's parent" is
    emitted, which appears to be benign.

 -- Bernard Giannetti <thebernmeister@hotmail.com>  Fri, 24 Aug 2012 17:29:37 +1000

  * Default sort now matches that given by the VirtualBox UI (rather than
    VBoxManage).
  * The update of the running status of the VMs in the menu is now
    configurable between 1 and 60 minutes.  Note that an update also occurs
    each time a VM is started and when the preferences dialog is
    ok'd/cancelled.
  * Big thanks to Pascal De Vuyst (https://launchpad.net/~pascal-devuyst)
    for suggestions/patches for preferences and sorting!

    the front (using wmctrl).
  * Removed the refresh menu item.  The list of VMs in the menu are now
    automatically refreshed every 15 minutes.
  * Fixed an issue where the indicator believes a VM is running but is in

indicator-virtual-box (1.0.0-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Tested on Ubuntu but should work for Lubuntu/Xubuntu.
  * On Lubuntu/Xubuntu, user needs to manually remove spurious directory
      /usr/share/icons/elementary/status/48/untitled
    then rebuild the image cache
      sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/elementary
  * If 'Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap"' appears on
    execution, install "sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf".
  * The indicator will run without 'virtualbox' installed...but it'll do
    nothing useful!
