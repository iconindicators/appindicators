#TODO If/when Skyfield is released, this will not install on 32 bit becuase of numpy.
# So keep PyEphem in addition to Skyfield.
#
# For the dependencies below, remove ephem.
# In the pip install instructions, use bash trickery to determine if
# 32 bit or 64 bit and adjust the install line to include PyEphem or
# both PyEphem and Skyfield.
# For Skyfield, also specify pandas for use in minor planets / comets).
