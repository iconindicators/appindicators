#TODO If/when Skyfield is released, remove ephem from the dependencies below,
# leaving only sgp4.
#
# In the Python PyPI install instructions, either ephem or skyfield
# (with pandas/numpy) will be installed by checking (using bash trickery)
# if 32 bit or 64 bit respectively.
#
# For Skyfield, specify pandas in the pip install instructions
# (used by minor planets / comets).
