#TODO If/when Skyfield is released,
# this will not install on 32 bit becuase of numpy.
# So keep PyEphem in addition to Skyfield.
#
# In the dependencies below, remove ephem, leaving sgp4
# as it is used by both PyEphem and Skyfield and works on both 32 and 64 bit,
#
# In the pip PyPI install instructions, use some sort of bash/script trickery
# to determine if the end user is running on 32 bit or 64 bit
# and adjust the install line to include PyEphem or both PyEphem and Skyfield.
# However at this stage, not sure if running on 64 bit should install PyEphem
# along with Skyfield.  Why install PyEphem?
#
# For Skyfield, specify pandas in the pip install instructions
# (used by minor planets / comets).
