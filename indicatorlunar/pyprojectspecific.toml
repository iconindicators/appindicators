#TODO If/when Skyfield is released, cannot do so for 32 bit,
# so release both Skyfield and PyEphem.
# For the dependencies below, remove ephem (and instead in the pip install,
# use bash trickery to determine if 32 bit or 64 bit and adjust the install
# line to include PyEphem or both PyEphem and Skyfield.

            # needed in the satellite stuff irrespective of pyephem or skyfield.
